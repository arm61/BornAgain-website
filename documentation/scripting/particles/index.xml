      <description>Particle positioning This tutorial demonstrates how to include particles in various layers of a multi-layer system.
As an example we are going to use simple spherical particles and a 3-layer system consisting of a semi-infinite air layer, a middle layer with finite thickness and a semi-infinite substrate layer.
Creating particles All particles implemented in BornAgain are defined by their form factors, their sizes and the materials they are made of. While placing particles in layers it is important to know the reference point of the particle and how the coordinate system of the surrounding layer is defined.</description>

      <title>Particle distribution</title>

      <description>Particle distribution This tutorial gives an overview on how to draw a set of particles whose parameters follow a desired distribution. To fix ideas, let&amp;rsquo;s build the argument around cylindrical particles; In this case, the parameters will be radius, $r$; and height, $h$; the same reasoning should apply to other kinds of particles whose parameters differ (e.g. an Icosahedron does not have a parameter &amp;ldquo;radius&amp;rdquo;).
  
  No distribution In the case in which a particle distribution is not applied, all particles are identical; for cylindrical particles, this means having the same radius and the same height (the default value is $5 , \rm{nm}$ for both).</description>

      <description>Particle rotation This tutorial gives an overview on how to rotate a particle in different ways.
Initial orientation The rotation of particles starts from a known standard orientation. This orientation is represented by the motionless reference coordinate system of the particle and it is defined in the User Manual. In this tutorial we are going to use a box shaped particle with defined length, width and height. The picture below represents the initial orientation of the box shape.</description>

      <description>Particle composition This tutorial demonstrates how to construct complex shape particles.
All particles implemented in BornAgain are defined by their form factors, their sizes and the materials they are made of. The form factor library provides access to a list of about 20 elementary shapes. A special ParticleComposition object allows to compose elementary particles into complex shapes and treat the resulting object as a single particle: it can be rotated, translated and included in the layer via a particle layout.</description>

      <title>Magnetic particles</title>

      <description>Magnetic particles This tutorial demonstrates how to include particles with non-zero magnetization.
As an example we are going to use magnetic spherical particles embedded in the substrate of a simple 2-layer system. We will simulate this sample with a polarized beam and use polarization analysis to focus on the spin-flip channel.
Creating materials with magnetization density Magnetic materials in BornAgain are defined by their refractive index, as for non-mangetic materials, and the magnetization density vector, given in units of A/m.</description>
