      <description>Interference function of a one-dimensional lattice A one dimensional lattice can be viewed as a chain of particles placed at regular intervals on a single axis. The plot below represents one possible use case, where infinitely long (or very long) boxes are placed at nodes of a 1d lattice to form a grating.
  
  See the BornAgain user manual (Chapter 3.4.1, One Dimensional Lattice) for details about the theory.</description>

      <description>Interference function of a 2D lattice The interference function of a two-dimensional lattice is used to model the scattering from particles positioned at some regular intervals.
  
  The generated layout, the lattice, is characterised by two basis vectors $a$ and $b$ (in real space) and the angle between these two vectors. The finite size effects and/or divergence of the lattice from an ideal crystal are modelled with the help of two-dimensional decay functions.</description>

      <description>Interference function of radial paracrystal The interference function of a radial paracrystal is used to model cumulative disorder of interparticle distances. It is called radial to stress the fact that it only takes into account the radial component of the scattering vector.
  
  Each circle on the plot above represents the area where the probability to find a particle, given a particle at the origin, is above some arbitrary threshold.</description>

      <description>Interference function of 2D paracrystal Similarly to the 2D interference function, the 2D paracrystal is used to model the scattering from particles positioned at some regular intervals on a plane. However, the 2D paracrystal model posesses only short range order. The disorder is cumulative at further distance.
  
  The plot above represents a schematic view of the 2D paracrystal. Each circle on the plot represents an area where the probability to find a particle, given a particle at the origin, is above some arbitrary threshold.</description>

      <description>3D Particle Assemblies 3D nanoparticle arrangements obtained using different techniques are complex, but quite frequent kinds of samples being studied with GISAS. Depending on the properties of the particular sample you may choose one of 2 ways to represent a 3D particle arrangement in a BornAgain simulation:
 Particle compositions arranged in a lattice Mesocrystal  Below you will find a detailed description of each option.
