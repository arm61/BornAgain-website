#### BornAgain 1.9 has been released
{{< /alert >}}


This release includes a new formalism for polarized neutron scattering, where the materials are defined by their magnetization instead of a homogeneous B-field.
The loading and saving of project files in the GUI has also been improved in terms of responsiveness and performance.

**API changes:**

None

**Summary of other changes:**

1. Magnetic scattering: New formalism that uses the magnetization of the different materials instead of the B-field
1. GUI: Project saving now done in seperate thread.
1. Documentation: tutorials explaining interference functions and magnetic scattering
1. Bugfixes.
