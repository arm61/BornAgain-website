{{< /alert >}}

Our paper
[BornAgain: software for simulating and fitting grazing-incidence small-angle scattering](http://journals.iucr.org/j/issues/2020/01/00/ge5067/)
has appeared in the February 2020 issue of Journal of Applied Crystallography.

The paper gives a broad overview over the scope of BornAgain,
the software architecture, and the modelled physics.
For years to come, it will be the canonical reference for BornAgain.
