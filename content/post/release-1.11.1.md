#### A bugfix release for BornAgain is now available
{{< /alert >}}


**This is a hotfix release that fixes the following issues:**

1. Plot ticks are not updated in real time activity.
1. Entering floating point numbers in GUI behaves weird.
1. ROI in experimental data causes NaN fitting parameters.

As always, we very much welcome your comments and feedback!
