## Simulation classes

To prepare and run a BornAgain simulation, one needs to create an instance of
one a `Simulation` class. This class is then populated with information
about the scattering target ("sample") and about the simulated instrument
(beam and detector).

The following tutorial pages describe the typical simulation workflow for the
different fundamental types of simulations in BornAgain:

* [GISAS simulation]({{% ref-tutorial "simulation-classes/gisas" %}})
* [Reflectometry simulation]({{% ref-tutorial "simulation-classes/reflectometry" %}})
* [Depth-probe simulation]({{% ref-tutorial "simulation-classes/depth-probe" %}})
