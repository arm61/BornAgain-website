Use the BornAgain icon located on the desktop (Windows) or on Launchpad (MacOS) to start the GUI.

For Linux users: run an executable located in BornAgain installation directory from the command line:
```bash
$ <install_dir>/bin/BornAgain
```

### 2. Switch to the Sample View

When you start the BornAgain GUI, you will be presented with the Welcome View as shown on the plot. Switch to the Sample View by clicking on the pictogram marked on the left panel.
