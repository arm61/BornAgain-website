## How to request help
## How to report bugs
## How to propose improvements

For all these,
please create an issue on [Github](https://github.com/scgmlz/BornAgain) or send us an [e-mail](mailto:contact@bornagainproject.org).

Especially for bug reports, supply all relevant information that may help us to analyse the issue.
In particular, submit the full output of the last, unsuccessful command
(screen copy, or redirection `[command] >& [logfile]`).
