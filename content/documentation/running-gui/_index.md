## Using Graphical User Interface

The current BornAgain GUI allows to create basic multi-layered samples, populate them with particles, run scattering simulations and save the results in a publication quality form. However, it is still limited with respect to the functionality available via Python scripting.

**Backward compatibility**

We cannot guarantee that newer versions of BornAgain will be able to read older versions of GUI project files while GUI is in beta state. We expect backward compatibility of project files starting from the release v. 2.0.
